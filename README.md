    The Livestock Management System is a project that I developed as part of a school 
    assignment. It is a user-friendly application designed to assist livestock owners and 
    managers in efficiently managing and maintaining data for various types of livestock. A console equivalant can be found <a href="https://github.com/Tipzilla/LMS-Console-App">here</a>.
